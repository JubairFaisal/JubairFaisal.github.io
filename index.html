    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My transformative academic journey began at the age of 12, when I left home to attend a military high school named ‘Cumilla Cadet College’. Subsequently, I pursued my bachelor's degree from one of Bangladesh’s foremost universities for Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University, which has achieved the distinction of being the top institution in Bangladesh in the 2025 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Subject Rankings in Computer Science category. Recently, I graduated from the same institution with a master's degree from the same department. During my academic journeys, I gained valuable insights into the research on Machine Learning, which deepened further during my master’s project on Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Transfer learning, and Optimizers. These experiences nurtured my passion for research on medical imaging and computer vision-related research.

    <h2>Research Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ED2C3-EDNet-Pneumonia Detection Framework:</strong> Developed an ultra-lightweight and high-performing framework for pneumonia detection by integrating convo-
lutional neural networks (CNNs), ensemble learning, and knowledge distillation to achieve efficient and accurate
diagnosis. Multiple pre-trained models were analyzed and combined based on experimental performance to
enhance generalization. Datasets from two different sources were merged and extensively preprocessed to im-
prove data quality, feature extraction, and model robustness. The ADASYN method was applied to balance the
dataset, ensuring better learning and improved accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Finally,
knowledge from the complex ensemble model was distilled into a simpler model, significantly reducing size and
complexity while maintaining high accuracy and faster inference speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Down Syndrome Detection:</strong> Worked on Down syndrome detection in children using CNNs, transfer learning, and nature-inspired optimizers.
Since early detection of Down syndrome is crucial for effective treatment, an image-based detection system
was developed using facial images of children. Nature-inspired optimizers performed well for optimization, and
CNNs were an excellent fit for the study. An accuracy of 99% was achieved.</li>
