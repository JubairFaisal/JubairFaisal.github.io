<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<h3>Current Research Project &nbsp;&nbsp; Feb. 2025 – Present</h3>
<p><strong>Jahangirnagar University | Yangzhou University</strong> — Dhaka, Bangladesh | Yangzhou, China</p>
<p>Developed an ultra-lightweight and high-performing framework for pneumonia detection by integrating convo-
lutional neural networks (CNNs), ensemble learning, and knowledge distillation to achieve efficient and accurate
diagnosis. Multiple pre-trained models were analyzed and combined based on experimental performance to
enhance generalization. Datasets from two different sources were merged and extensively preprocessed to im-
prove data quality, feature extraction, and model robustness. The ADASYN method was applied to balance the
dataset, ensuring better learning and improved accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Finally,
knowledge from the complex ensemble model was distilled into a simpler model, significantly reducing size and
complexity while maintaining high accuracy and faster inference speed.
</p>
<h3>Master’s Research Project &nbsp;&nbsp; Feb. 2024 – Oct. 2024</h3>
<p><strong>Jahangirnagar University</strong> — Dhaka, Bangladesh</p>
<p>Worked on Down syndrome detection in children using CNNs, transfer learning, and nature-inspired optimizers.
Since early detection of Down syndrome is crucial for effective treatment, an image-based detection system
was developed using facial images of children. Nature-inspired optimizers performed well for optimization, and
CNNs were an excellent fit for the study. An accuracy of 99% was achieved.</p>

<h2>BSc Projects</h2>
<h3>Date Fruit Classification | 2023</h3>
<p>This two-member project, submitted for CSE-480: Project Work, developed “An Image-based Android Appli-
cation for Date Fruit Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)”. Using Python, we applied
machine learning to classify nine types of date fruits with CNN models trained on 1,658 images. The ReLU-
based model achieved 99.47% accuracy, then converted to TensorFlow Lite and integrated into an Android app
with a Java interface. The app enables real-time fruit recognition from camera or gallery images, providing a
fast, accurate, and automated solution for date fruit classification.</p>

<h3>FoodBee | 2021</h3>
<p>This project was completed for the course CSE308: System Analysis and Design Laboratory as part of a five-
member team. Initially, we developed the system as a web-based application, focusing on functionality, user
interaction, and database integration. Later, we extended the project by creating an Android application to
make the system more accessible and user-friendly across mobile platforms.</p>
